/*
  This migration adds in the concept of anchoring one activity directive's start time to another activity_directive's start or end time.
  Alternatively, an activity directive can be anchored to the plan's start or end time.
 */

/*
 Once https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/issues/567 has been resolved, future migrations will only need to drop the relative columns,
 instead of dropping all columns and recreating them in the correct order (done in this fashion to limit the amount of functions dropped).

 Additionally, dropping these tables is only possible because they are return types and *do not* hold any data.
