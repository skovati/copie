Future Considerations: 
    This area describes functionalities we may want to add later, but are not critical path to an MVP
    ArrayedResources (do we want to add more functionality to them?  Right now users can get similar functionality with normal resources) 
    Activities listening to other activities (currently, the functions are available in the activity class to make this possible.  
    However, currently, we are trying to accomplish all signals passed inside the SDK to be between resources and other objects)
